    <p> My name is Lily Feitelberg. I'm in the I school at Syracuse Univerisity; however, my real passion lies in entrepreneurship and fashion, so I am minoring in IDS, focusing on technology, design, and startups. I will be using this time in the I school to study technology and how it is used to improve business processes and inform decisions. To further my interest in business, I am currently working with four other women to launch an app to help filter and recommend extracurricular activities within communities for parents to find quality programs for their children. I enjoy anything that is artistic and spend most of my time drawing, painting, reading about fashion, creating aesthetic boards, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends.  In the next couple of years, I hope to launch my own business and create new and innovative ways to experience art and fashion. </p>
